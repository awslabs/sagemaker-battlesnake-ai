    "# Reinforcement Learning for Battlesnake AI Competitions \n",
    "\n",
    "This project shows how to build and deploy an AI for the platform [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/) on AWS with [Amazon Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is ready to deploy and contains learning materials for AI enthusiasts.\n",

    "__What is Battlesnake?__ (taken from [battlesnake.com](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/rules)):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Battlesnake is an autonomous survival game where your snake competes with others to find and eat food without being eliminated. To accomplish this, you will have to teach your snake to navigate the serpentine paths created by walls, other snakes, and their own growing tail without running out of energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project contains a ready-to-use AI for Battlesnake as well as a development environment that can be used to modify and improve the AI.\n",
    "The included AI makes movement decisions in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. [__Train a Neural Network Policy__](./2_PolicyTraining.ipynb)\n",
    "  2. [__Run Heuristics__](./3_HeuristicsDeveloper.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Several pre-trained neural network models are provided within this project as well as some default heuristics. These pre-trained models (snakes) are not designed to win the Battlesnake competition, so you'll have to improve them in order to have a chance of winning. The training environment is provided for you to make modifications and to retrain the neural network models in order to obtain better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heuristics module allows you to provide additional code that can override the neural network's predicted best action so that your snake avoids colliding with walls, eats food if it is safe to do so, attempts to eat a competitor snake, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",

    "If you use Steps 1-3, you will have the following deployed within your AWS account:\n",
